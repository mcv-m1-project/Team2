To execute the final system, run the function 'Color_segmentation'.
	This will generate a new folder called 'result_masks' inside the test data set folder with the obtained masks.

To run the full system (all the color segmentation methods) run the function 'Test_Algorithm'.
	This will generate a new folder called 'result_mask' inside the train data set folder with the obtained masks for each method.
